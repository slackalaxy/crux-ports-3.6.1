# crux-ports

This is my personal collection of CRUX ports. Many of them were written by me, others were adapted from existing ports. There are also some that were shamelessly stolen and put here so I have a single place for all. In these it just makes it more simple to have a unified place of "cherry picked" ports, rather a bunch of repos with overlapping entries.

I did all this in a hurry and it would be too complicated to track back the original authors, in order to credit them properly. So, if someone recognised their port and wants to have their name on it, let me know!
