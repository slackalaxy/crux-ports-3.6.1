# crux-ports

This is my personal collection of CRUX ports. Many of them were written
by me, others were adapted from existing ports. There are also some that
were shamelessly stolen and put here so I have a single place for all.
It just makes it more simple to have a unified place of "cherry picked"
ports, rather a bunch of repos with overlapping entries.

I did all this in a hurry and it would be too complicated to track back
the original authors, in order to credit them properly. So, if someone
recognised their port and wants to have their name on it, let me know!

There are 3 ports that are unversioned, they simply use the latest tar-
ball available:

* [custom/google-chrome](custom/google-chrome)
* [custom/viber](custom/viber)
* [custom/zoom-linux](custom/zoom-linux)

I can extract the version number from the archive, but it's just simpler
to do it that way. This can change of course.
